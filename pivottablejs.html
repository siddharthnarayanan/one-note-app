Documents are initially pushed to Relativity via Import API 
Four relational family fields exist in Relativity 

GroupID_Proposed 
GroupID_Validated 
ContractSetID_Proposed 
ContractSetID_Validated 


Documents are read into Accelerators 
Accelerators assigns values to docs that can be linked 

Accelerators write values to GroupID_Proposed for validation 

E.g., G00000001 


Accelerators write values to ContractSetID_Proposed for validation 

E.g., CS00000001 




Accelerators assigns values to docs that cannot be linked 

Accelerator assigns GroupID_Proposed = G_######## where each assignment is unique (every unassigned document gets a unique incremented value +1) 
Accelerator assigns ContractSetID_Proposed = CS_######## where each assignment is unique (every unassigned document gets a unique incremented value +1) 


Values are written back to Relativity via Python --> SQL 
Accelerator validation 

During validation, a user confirms the proposed linkage by transferring the value from GroupID_Proposed to GroupID_Validated and marking the document complete for the batch set 

If the family needs to be broken, the user changes the GroupID prefix of the affected family member from G######## --> G[A-Z]######## 


During validation, a user confirms the proposed linkage by transferring the value from ContractSetID_Proposed to ContractSetID_Validated and marking the document complete for the batch set 

If the ContractSetID needs to be broken, the user changes the ContractSetID prefix of the affected family member from CS######## --> CS[A-Z]######## 




Unassigned document linkage and validation 

Users review unassigned documents, which have G_######## unique values in GroupID_Proposed 
Users review unassigned documents, which have CS_######## unique values in ContractSetID_Proposed 
When a family of documents is identified, there are three scenarios  

If a G_######## document belongs to a family that contains a G_######## document, the user changes the proposed value to the corresponding G_######## value to link the documents together. In other words, G > G_ 
If multiple G_######## documents belong to the same family, the user conforms the proposed value for all docs to the smallest G_######## within the family 
If a G_######## document does not belong to a family then the proposed value remains G_######## (I.e., standalones retain their assigned G_#). 
User also performs the same task for CS. 


Upon accepting the value, the user copies the values to GroupID_Validated and ContractSetID_Validated and marks the document complete for the batch set. 


Rules 

G > G_ 
G is never downgraded to G_, it can only be changed to G[A-Z] 
If the user marks a document not in their batch, they mark a field indicating they did so (""hey I was here"") 


 

Which batches use which relational groups? Relativity todo 
What is the purpose of the Parent_Child_ID and when is it used? Doesn't make sense to assign before the ContractSetID is QCed and accepted. If it's not used within Relativity, it should be incremented after the family is done.

if multiple g_######## documents belong to the same family, the user conforms the proposed value for all docs to the smallest g_######## within the family 
if a g_######## document does not belong to a family then the proposed value remains g_######## (i.e., standalones retain their assigned g_#). 
user also performs the same task for cs. 


upon accepting the value, the user copies the values to groupid_validated and contractsetid_validated and marks the document complete for the batch set. 


rules 

g > g_ 
g is never downgraded to g_, it can only be changed to g[a-z] 
if the user marks a document not in their batch, they mark a field indicating they did so (""hey i was here"") 


 

which batches use which relational groups? relativity <h5 class='red-color'>todo</h5> 
what is the purpose of the parent_child_id and when is it used? doesn't make sense to assign before the contractsetid is qced and accepted. if it's not used within relativity, it should be incremented after the family is done.
